## Background
Hire Heroes USA empowers U.S. military members, veterans, and spouses to succeed in the civilian workforce.  Through our free, signature workshops and online programs, clients are individually partnered with a highly trained Veteran Transition Specialist who works with the client to: create a tailored civilian resume that effectively highlights skills and achievements, translate military experience into civilian terminology, learn effective job searching, networking and interviewing techniques, and get connected with companies that actively hire veterans.  

As a result, Hire Heroes USA confirms hired on average more than 60 clients per week.
